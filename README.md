## 📌 Project Overview
In the context of the global shift towards sustainable finance, this project conducts a comparative analysis between **Clean Energy (ICLN)** and **Fossil Fuels (XLE)** over a 5-year period. The objective is to determine whether "Green Investing" offers superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional energy sectors.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Methods
* **Libraries:** `yfinance` (Data Mining), `pandas`, `seaborn` (Heatmaps), `matplotlib`.
* **Statistical Methods:**
    * **Rebasing:** Normalized asset prices to 100 for accurate growth comparison.
    * **Correlation Matrix:** Analyzed the relationship coefficient between renewable and non-renewable energy assets to test diversification benefits.

## 📊 Key Findings

### 1. Growth vs. Stability
* **Clean Energy (ICLN):** Showed explosive growth during 2020-2021 but exhibited higher volatility (risk).
* **Fossil Fuels (XLE):** Demonstrated resilience and strong recovery during geopolitical crises (e.g., 2022 energy crisis), acting as a hedge against inflation.

### 2. Correlation & Diversification
* The correlation between the two sectors was found to be **low to moderate**.
* **Implication:** Adding Green Energy to a traditional portfolio provides excellent **diversification benefits**, reducing overall portfolio risk.
